    <h1>Anatomy of a Widget</h1>
    <p>
      A widget is, most basically, simply a folder in our repository (linked
      above) that contains a <code>widget.js</code> file. The directory
      structure tends to look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
myWidget
|-- widget.js
|-- chat
|   |-- index.js
|   +-- more_supporting_files
+-- test
    |-- one.test.js
    +-- another.test.js</pre>
    <p>The <code>widget.js</code> might look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">module.exports = {
  // Package name
  name: 'Polls',
  // Whether it's enabled by default
  default: true,
  // Beam username(s) of the author(s).
  authors: ['connor4312'],
  // Hooks for Beam chat servers/frontend.
  hooks: {
      chat: require('./chat')
  },
  // Description to display to users.
  description: 'Allow people to create polls and let viewers vote on them!',
  // Additional permissions roles should get to use the widget.
  permissions: {
      User:  ['chat:poll_vote'],
      Mod:   ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start'],
      Admin: ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start'],
      Owner: ['chat:poll_vote', 'chat:poll_start']
  }
};</code></pre>
    <p>
      It's mostly straightforward. The two parts that might need additional 
      explanation are the permissions and hooks. Hooks is a map of strings 
      to functions to register your widget various "environments" (currently, 
      chat is the only available hook, but this will expand in the future). 
      The process for hooking differs between environments; refer to the 
      sections below for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permissions are simply an array of permission strings that your widget 
      needs to operate. In the example, you can see that we let Users, Mods, 
      Admins, and Owners have a permission to vote in polls, but only Mods, 
      Admins, and Owners have permission to start polls. You can verify and 
      restrict access based on permissions in individual hooks.

    <h2>Chat</h2>
    <p>
      We allow you to hook into the chat server backend, adding
      middleware-like functions to modify or abort ongoing actions.
      Backend widgets are written in Node.js, and will be reviewed fairly
      rigorously as they'll be running in a production environment!
      In general:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unit test your modules the best you're able to. We've got a nice
        stack of Mocha mixed with Chai and Sinon, along with useful
        fixtures, whipped up for you. Check out the "test" folders of
        existing widgets for reference.
      </li>
      <li>Errors should be logged and handled gracefully.</li>
      <li>Avoid, whenever possible, additional network calls or database hits.</li>
      <li>Use jsdoc's format to document your code.</li>
      <li>
        Run npm test locally before opening a pull request. This will run
        all tests and verify your code against our linters and code style
        guide.
      </li>
      <li>Write beautiful code. We love beautiful code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following modules are installed on the chat server available for
      you to consume anywhere in your widget. We'd prefer to avoid adding
      additional modules for widgets; if you think that you absolutely need
      something, let us know and we'll find a solution.

    <h2>Building Chat Hooks</h2>
    <p>
      On the chat server we can hook into both events and methods, which
      provide two distinct types of functionality. When a user wants to do
      one specific task, they trigger a method for it, and that's the only
      time a method can be called. Events, on the other hand, can be
      triggered in a variety of circumstances, such as a user joining a
      channel, a chat message being sent, or your own events!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that not every user of a chat will be
      connected to the same chat server instance. For communication across
      chats, we generally publish Redis events using the <code>channel.emit</code>
      method, then listen for them later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's get started! Be sure to have the JSDoc for the chat server
      (linked at the top of the page) open for reference, and an existing
      widget as well.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">// Example hooks file `polls/chat/index.js`
  module.exports = function (hook) {
    hook.method('permission', 'vote:start', ['poll_start', require('./start').hook]);
    hook.method('permission', 'vote:choose', ['poll_vote', require('./vote')]);
    hook.event('PollStart', require('./events').start);
    hook.event('PollEnd', require('./events').end);
  };</code></pre>

    <h3>Method Hooks</h3>
    <p>
      Method hooks are triggered by a user sending a "message" directly to
      the chat server. The handler methods can be defined as guarded or
      unguarded:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td style="width: 350px"><code>.method(String event, Function handler)</code></td>
        <td><p>
          The simplest invocation. Your handler function won't be guarded.
          Anyone, including guests, can send the method. Handler will be
          called with <code>(WebSocket socket, Array args, Function respond).</code>
        </p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="width: 350px"><code>.method(String guard, String event, Any handler)</code></td>
        <td><p>
          You function will be guarded by the guard you specify. Currently we have:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>user</code> - Your handler should be a function. It
              won't be run unless the requesting user is authenticated.
              Its arguments will be
              <code>(User user, Array args, Function respond)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>permissions</code> - Your handler should be an array.
              The first element should be the permission name, the second
              should be a function. The function won't be run unless the
              user is authenticated and has the given permission. Arguments
              are the same as the above.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Event Hooks</h3>
    <p>
      Event hooks are a bit simpler. They are currently only triggered by
      events emitted across Redis, and are called with the data they were
      broadcast on and arbitrary data. Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">/**
 * Handles a new creation poll event. It attaches an _ongoing_vote vote
 * to the channel object for use later, and broadcasts to users.
 * @param  {Object} channel
 * @param  {Object} data
 */
module.exports.start = function (channel, data) {
  channel._ongoing_vote = data.endsAt;
  channel.broadcast('PollStart', data);
};</code></pre>

    <p>
      You can trigger these events yourself as well, by using the
      <code>channel.emit</code> method. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">channel.emit('PollStart', {
  question: question,
  answers: answers,
  duration: duration,
  endsAt: Date.now() + duration * 1000
});</code></pre>
