    <h1>Connection</h1>
    <p>
      To connect to the chat server, first retrieve details from
      <code>GET /chats/join</code>. If you are authenticated in the request
      you will recieve an authkey in the response for authentication purposes.
      You may join chat and read messages without being authenticated, but you
      will not be able to participate in chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To connect to a chat, you should randomly chose an address from the
      endpoints array. If you lose connection to a server, you should
      re-connect to a different server (this can be chosen randomly or via
      round-robining).
    </p>
    <p>
      After connecting to a server, you'll need to authenticate. The details for 
      that are described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Chat Protocol</h2>
    <p>
      Our chat servers use a standard secure websocket protocol (<code>wss</code>) 
      as defined in RFC6455. We do not use Socket.io or other "wrapper" systems due 
      to unnecessary overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client and server send <code>JSON</code> "packets" back and forth.
      There are three types of packets.
    </p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <span>The following properties must be set on the packet:</span>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>type</code></td>
        <td>Should be set to <code>method</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>method</code></td>
        <td>The method name to execute.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>arguments</code></td>
        <td>An array of arguments, specific per method type.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>id</code></td>
        <td>
          Should be a unique numeric ID. If the method you sent requires a
          reply, the numeric ID will be sent back down in the Reply packet.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Event</h3>
    <span>The following properties must be set on the packet:</span>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>type</code></td>
        <td>Should be set to <code>event</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>event</code></td>
        <td>The event name.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>data</code></td>
        <td>Associated event data - may be of any type, specific to the event.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Client Actions</h2>
    <h3>Authenticiate</h3>
    <p>
      The "auth" packet can be sent to the server in order to identify the
      client connection as being a particular user. Successful authentication
      is required in order to chat. The client should send an auth method
      packet with the following parameters:
      <ul>
        <li><code>method</code> should be set to <code>auth</code></li>
        <li>
          <code>arguments</code> should be set to an array of, in order, the
          channel ID, your user ID, and the authkey.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">// Client packet:
{"type":"method","method":"auth","arguments":[2,2,"174d77b785221a570773511799271d59"],"id":1}
// Server Response:
{"type":"reply","error":null,"id":1,"data":{"authenticated":true,"role":"Owner"}}</code></pre>

    <h3>Send Chat</h3>
    <p>
      Send a chat message! This is a method packet. No reply will be recieved
      unless there was an error sending.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">// Client packet:
{"type":"method","method":"msg","arguments":["Hello World!"],"id":2}
// No server reply should be expected except on error.</code></pre>

    <h3>Vote in poll</h3>
    <p>
      This is a method packet that adds a user vote to a poll selection, by
      the option index in the answers array that the server initially sent down.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">// Client packet:
{"type":"method","method":"vote","arguments":[0],"id":3}
// Server response:
{"type":"reply","error":null,"id":3,"data":true}</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Server actions</h2>
    <h3>Incoming chat message</h3>
    <p>
      An event packet is recieved on the client, with the event name of
      <code>ChatMessage</code>. It has the following structure:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">{
  "type":"event",
  "event":"ChatMessage",
  "data":{
    // Channel ID it was sent on
    "channel":2,
    // Unique message ID
    "id":"db10fc70-bc95-11e4-8ddb-9f6d8dc74385",
    // Information about the sender
    "user_name":"connor4312",
    "user_id":2,
    "user_roles":["Owner"],
    "message":{
      "message":[
        { "type":"text", "data":"hello " },
        { "type": 'emoticon', "text": ':)', "path": 'default/1F604' }
      ],
      meta:{}
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      It's fairly straightforward, except for the message property of the data.
      It contains a property called message which is an array of components 
      that tell the client how the message should be rendered. The following components
      are currently in place:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>text</code></td>
        <td>
          Contains only a data with plain text. The text is not HTML escaped -
          you should escape this if you're displaying in-browser to prevent XSS.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>link</code></td>
        <td>
          Indicated a clickable link. Contains a <code>url</code> to direct
          to and the <code>text</code> which should be linked.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>emoticon</code></td>
        <td>
          Contains the path of the emoticon on
          <a href="https://github.com/WatchBeam/emoticons">WatchBeam/emoticons</a>
          and the original <code>text</code> typed to create the emoticon.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Start of a poll</h3>
    <p>
      This is triggered when a new poll is started on the channel. It's
      in the event packet format.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">{
  "type":"event",
  "event":"PollStart",
  "data":{
    // Question to display to users.
    "q":"Should I go left or right?",
    // JSON encoded string of results
    "answers":"[\"left\",\"right\"]",
    // Duration of the poll in seconds and the unix time it ends.
    "duration":30,
    "endsAt":1424832044051
  }
}</code></pre>

    <h3>End of a poll</h3>
    <p>
      This is an event packet sent when a poll ends and may be used to display
      results to a user.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">{
  "type":"event",
  "event":"PollEnd",
  "data":{
    "voters":"1",
    "responses":{
      "right":"2",
      "left":"5"
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    <h3>User Join</h3>
    <p>Packet is sent whenever a new user joins the channel.</p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">{"type":"event","event":"UserJoin","data":{"username":"connor4312","role":"Owner","id":1}}</pre></code>

    <h3>User Leave</h3>
    <p>
      Packet is sent whenever a user completely exits a channel. For example,
      this is not sent if a user has multiple browser windows open with the
      chat and closes one of them.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">{"type":"event","event":"UserLeave","data":{"username":"connor4312","role":"Owner","id":1}}</pre></code>
