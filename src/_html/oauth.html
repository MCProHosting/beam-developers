      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to act as another user in chat, access a users' private resources as part of your app,
        or just want to use Beam credentials to authenticate your users, it's best to use OAuth so the users'
        credentials don't need to be stored on your servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        OAuth is a system that replaces traditional user/password combos with app-specific tokens. Your app
        can request a set of tokens for a certain user with a specific set of permissions. This way your app
        only gets access to what it needs and all other details will stay hidden. It's a win-win scenario for
        both your app's functionality, and our user's privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start using OAuth create an application as described below.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Registering your application</h2>
      <p>
        To create an application head over to the <a href="/oauth/manage">Manage OAuth</a> page!
        (You may need to authorize the developers site first). Once there, click the <code>Create New</code>
        button in the top right corner and it'll open the creation form.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page you'll need to enter some basic details about your application, like its name, website and
        logo. All of these details will be displayed publically to users of your app.
      </p>
      <h3>Hosts</h3>
      <p>
        The hosts parameter is an important one; it tells us what domains your application can redirect to.
        This should be set to domains you control. You can use wildcards, for example: <code>*.beam.pro</code>
        will allow redirects to all subdomains on beam.pro, but not beam.pro itself. The list of domains is
        comma separated if you want to add multiple ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Using OAuth</h2>
      <p>
        The OAuth 2.0 protocol is simple enough, but that doesn't mean you should implement it from scratch.
        Most popular languages will have a library to easily interface with an OAuth server.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in reading an in depth explanation of how OAuth works head
        <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use our OAuth implementation you'll just need a few details which can be found at the top of the page
        and on your <a href="/oauth/manage">Manage OAuth</a> page.

      <h2>OAuth Scopes</h2>
      <p>
        To request access to a users' account you need to use scopes. Scopes limit the amount of access a certain 
        application has to the account. Below are all the scopes you can use. If you're requesting multiple, make 
        sure to use spaces in between them!
      </p>

        <li>
