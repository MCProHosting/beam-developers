h1#interactive__connection Connection
p.
    To make a connection you first need to have an authenticated session with our
    #[a(href='#') REST API]. Once you have one you make a #[code GET] request to
    #[code /interactive/{channel}/robot] where #[code channel] is the channel id of the
    channel you wish to connect to.
include ../../tutorials/channelid.pug
p.
    In response to the request you'll receive a WebSocket address and a key:
+highlightFile('json','./tutorials/code/node/interactive/2_response.json')

p.
    A connection should then be made to the received address with #[code /robot] appended. The key and
    channel id must be included in the #[code Handshake] packet.

h2(id='interactive__flow') Data Flow

p Then general protocol flow is the following:

pre
    include ./protocol.ascii
ol
    li The Client establishes a TCP connection to the server. It sends a Handshake packet, populated with the channel ID and auth key.
    li Mixer Interactive verifies the key. If it's correct, a blank HandshakeACK packet is sent. If it's not correct, an Error packet is sent down.
    li Mixer Interactive repeatedly sends Reports down to the Client every #[code reportInterval].
    li The Client can send Progress Updates to the Server at it's discretion.

h2(id='interactive__packets') Packets
p.
    Protocol Buffer packets are encoded in a binary websocket frame. They start with their their packet ID, formatted as variable length unsigned integers. Variable-length integers are described in the #[a(href='https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints') protocol buffer specification].

p A single packet can be represented as follows:
pre.
    ┌───────────────────────┐
    │  Packet ID (varuint)  │
    └───────────────────────┘
    ┌───────────────────────┐
    │      Packet Data      │
    │   (protocol buffer)   │
    .........................
p.
    The protocol is bi-directional. Mixer Interactive expects information sent
    to it to be encoded in prescribed format, and it will in turn send
    information in the same format.
p.
    Packet ID mapping is as follows:
table.table
    tr
        th ID
        th Packet
    tr
        td 0
        td Handshake
    tr
        td 1
        td HandshakeACK
    tr
        td 2
        td Report
    tr
        td 3
        td Error
    tr
        td 4
        td Progress Update
h2(id='interactive__protocol') Specification
p.
    The protocol buffer specification for Mixer interactive lists packet types and
    structures within those packets in more detail:
