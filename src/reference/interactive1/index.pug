        p These reference docs are for Interactive 1. Check out our #[a(href='/reference/interactive/index.html') Interactive 2 docs].

    p Mixer Interactive is a new way to let viewers directly control the environment around streamers using a visual interface. It works with any game and is built into the Mixer platform. Interactive games can be played with streamers or fully autonomously.

    p Developers can create integrations with as few as 25 lines of code and receive input from viewers to influence a live stream directly.

    h1(id='interactive__introduction') Introduction
    p Our interactive platform communicates using #[a(href='https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/') Google's Protocol Buffer] specification over a standard secure websocket protocol #[code wss] connection. Viewers' inputs from the site are sent to Mixer's aggregator server, which analyzes them for you, before being sent to clients.
