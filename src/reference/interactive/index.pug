    h2#introduction Introduction

    p This documentation provides an overview of Beam Interactive features and explains how developers can use them to add interactivity into their game or application.
    
    p Beam Interactive enables viewers, also known as participants, to directly control the environment in and around streamer’s broadcasts by interacting with user interface (UI) controls. When a live streaming video has interactivity enabled, UI controls appear beneath the video on the viewer’s screen. These controls dynamically change according to live events and update in response to different situations that occur in the broadcast.

    p Developers and producers can create interactive experiences, through the Beam Interactive Studio, which can run as a part of a game, entirely as a standalone application, or as a tool. These experiences are then used by broadcasters to make their broadcasts interactive.

    p When a viewer interacts with the controls, their input is sent directly to the experience, allowing all viewers to see exactly who is interacting and what they are doing. This level of engagement allows for the creation of truly unique and interactive experiences that let viewers and broadcasters experience Beam broadcasts on a whole new level. 

    h2#overview Overview

    p These four major components that make up an interactive experience:

    ol(style='list-style-type: decimal')
        li Game Client
        li Interactive Service
        li Interactive Project
        li Participants

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/HighLevelOverview.svg' alt='Diagram showing the structure of an interactive project')
        p.caption Diagram shows the structure of an interactive project

    h3#the-gameclient The Game Client
    p A Game Client is software code which processes interactive events. It is written by developers who want to create an interactive experience. Game Clients connect to the #[a(href='#the-interactive-service') Interactive Service], listens to events and updates sent from the service to take action within their environment, thus affecting the broadcast.

    p You can add Game Client code as part of various environments, including:
    ul
        li Game's current codebase
        li Third party mod of a game
        li Standalone application
        li Game's server-side service

    h3#the-interactive-service The Interactive Service

    p The Interactive Service is a service operated by Beam. A Game Client connects to it to create an interactive session. Once a session is established, the service acts as a mediator for the Interactive session. The service manages data flow and state within the session by processing and distributing data sent to and from both the #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] and #[a(href='#participants') Participants]. The Game Client sends messages to the service when it needs to update the session state or to interact with the session. 

    h3#an-interactive-project An Interactive Project

    p The Interactive Project stores settings and metadata about your interactive experience. It is created by developers through the #[a(href='https://beam.pro/i/studio' target='_blank') Beam Interactive Studio]. Projects are owned by a single Beam user but can be #[a(href='#sharing-your-project') shared] with other users.

    p Within the Studio you can:
    ul
        li Edit your project's name and description
        li Create and store controls and scenes
        li Control who can access your project
        li Publish your project for everyone on Beam to see and use

    p When a #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] connects to the Interactive Service, it provides your project's ID to the service. The service reads this ID and sets up an interactive session with the saved settings and controls created in the Studio.

    h3#participants Participants

    p Participants are viewers of a live stream. They are Beam users watching a broadcast in a broadcaster's channel. When they join the channel, they are connected to the interactive session. They are provided with a set of on-screen UI controls that they can use to affect the broadcast. A #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] can react to game scenarios and interactive input to change the controls displayed to participants.

    h2#interactive-experience-structure Interactive Experience Structure

    p In this section, let’s look at the hierarchical structure of the various elements that developers can use to create this interaction.

    p These elements are:
    ul
        li Scenes
        li Controls
        li Groups
        li Participants

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/InteractiveHierarchy.svg' alt='Relationship between elements in the interactive hierarchy.')

    p.caption Diagram shows the relationship between elements in the interactive hierarchy.

    h3#scenes Scenes

    p A scene is a named collection of controls. Within a scene, controls are arranged on a grid. This grid layout determines how they are displayed to participants.
    
    p The #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] can add or remove controls from a scene. It controls which scenes (and controls) are shown to which participants throughout the session. Scenes are used to group controls together in a coherent fashion that is meaningful to the experience.

    p For example, in an adventure game, you might have a "Battle" scene displayed when a broadcaster's game character is in battle; a "Field" scene displayed when the character is walking around in the game world.

    p All #[a(href='#an-interactive-project') Interactive Projects] has a default scene. If no proper set up info is provided by the #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client], all participants and #[a(href='#groups') groups] are shown the default scene.

    p The #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] can change the scene a participant sees by updating the #[a(href='#groups') group] they belong to.

    h3#groups Groups
    p Individual participants can be grouped together using the Groups feature. Participants within a group all see the same Scene and contribute input to the controls that are part of that scene. #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Clients] can create and update groups any time, including changing to the scene that the group is set to see.

    p Groups can be used to create team-based experiences where groups compete to achieve a goal within the experience. Using an adventure game again as an example, you could create a "Allies" group and a "Adversaries" group.
    The ”Allies” group is provided with controls that gives them the ability to heal the character that the broadcaster is controlling or grant buffs to increase their chance of winning. Alternatively, the ”Adversaries” group could spawn traps or monsters to try to get in the way of winning - using their controls.

    p Participants always start out in the default group but #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Clients] can re-assign participants into any group.

    h3#controls Controls
    p A control is an interactive element in a graphical user interface within a scene. #[a(href='#participants') Participants] can interact with the control using touch, keyboard, mouse, or controller. There are currently has two types of controls - Buttons and Joysticks. Additional control types may be added in the future.

    h4#buttons Buttons
    
    p A button is a type of control. They are rectangular, interactive controls within a scene. #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Clients] receive events when participants interact with a button.
    
    ul
        li #[code Down] event is sent when a button is pressed by a participant
        li #[code Up] event is sent when a button is released by a participant
    
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/button.png' alt='Sample button control which costs the participant one spark if they click on it.')
    p.caption Sample button control which costs the participant one spark if they click on it.
    
    p Developers can use buttons to enable participants to vote, cause in-game actions to happen, or control in-game entities.

    p Buttons are customizable. These button properties can be edited from both the Interactive Studio and a Game Client:
    ol(style='list-style-type: decimal')
        li Display text string
        li Spark cost (For more info about sparks, go to #[a(href='#what-are-sparks') What are Sparks?]
        li Width of the progress bar, which is displayed at the bottom of a button
        li Disable property - Disabled buttons cannot be interacted with
        li Cooldown duration - Prevents interaction until it expires

    h5#what-are-sparks What are Sparks?

    p Sparks are Beam's virtual currency. Participants earn them while watching or participating in live broadcasts everywhere on Beam.

    h5#spark-transactions Spark Transactions
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/TransactionLifecycle.svg' alt='Diagram of a transaction\'s life cycle')
    p.caption Diagram of a spark transaction's life cycle, showing its transition betwen states.

    p When a button with a spark cost is pressed, it creates a transaction. To deduct sparks from a participant, a #[a(href='#the-game-client') Game Client] must #[code capture] the transaction. If a transaction remains uncaptured for 5 minutes, it automatically expires, and the cost associated with the transaction is not deducted from the participant's spark balance.

    p This mechanism allows the #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Client] to decide whether sparks should be deducted from a participant. This feature is a great way to ensure that input from a participant has been converted into the expected action associated with the button click before deducting sparks from their balance.

    p Note that deducted sparks are #[strong not] transferred to the broadcaster.

    h4#joysticks Joysticks

    p Joysticks are circular controls positioned within a scene that participants can click and drag. Moving a joystick sends an input event down to the Game Client with the coordinates of the joystick relative to its center. Joystick coordinates range between #[code -1 and 1].
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/joystick.png' alt='A joystick display to a participant.')
    p.caption An idle joystick displayed to a participant. Its coordinates are #[code 0, 0].

    p Download the appropriate SDK that your project needs from the repository and create a new project in your favorite IDE.

    h3#creating-an-interactive-project Create a new Interactive Project
    
    p Interactive projects are created and configured in the #[a(href='https://beam.pro/i/studio' target='_blank') Beam Interactive Studio]. 
    
    
    p Go to #[a(href='https://beam.pro/i/studio' target='_blank') Studio] and click on the #[strong plus] button to create a new project.

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/createNewProject.png' alt='Screenshot showing the location of the create new project button')
    p.caption Screenshot shows the location of the Create new project button.

    p You'll then be prompted to enter a name for your project. Enter a suitable name for your project.
    
    p After creating the project, you can still modify your project using the editor.

    h3#configure-build-publish-the-project Configure, build, and publish the project
    p The project editor contains tabs where each tab is a step in the creation of your project. Use the project editor to configure, build, and publish your project.
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/editorTabs.png' alt='studio editor tabs')
        
    p The editor consists of these four tabs:
    ul
        li Info - Edit the project name and metadata
        li Build - Configure Scenes and Controls
        li Code - Hook your Game Client up to the Project and start coding
        li Publish - Submit your project for review by the Beam team.
    
    h3#the-info-step Info
    p The info step is your opportunity to describe your project and provide potential users with all the information they need to get up and running.
    p It is important to describe what your project does and how to install it in a clear and concise way so that users understand what you have developed and how to use it. Be sure to include some information on how users can contact you if they need help or want to report an issue.
    p During the pre-publish review process, the Beam team examines your project more closely. We use this info to gain an understanding of what your project does, so be as thorough as possible.

    h3#the-build-step Build

    p The build step is where you design your scenes and controls for your project. The interface is divided up into three sections:
    ul
        li Scenes
        li Controls
        li Grid

    h4#scenes-area Scenes section

    p This is where you'll manage the scenes for your project. Scenes can be created, renamed, or deleted here. You can also select a specific scene that you would like to manage controls for.

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/scenes.png' alt='studio scenes')

    h4#controls-area Controls section

    p This is where you'll manage the controls in your project. You can create, rename, change their type (button or joystick), adjust spark cost, or delete controls here.

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/controls.png' alt='studio controls')

    h4#grid-area Grid section

    p The grid is how you specify the layout of your controls for the scene. There are three different layouts for which you can set the look of the scene: small (mobile phones), medium (tablets), and large (desktops). These different layouts are indicated by icons in the upper left area of the grid section.

    p To add a control to the grid, click and drag the control from the Controls section on to the Grid section. Once the control has been added to the grid you have the ability to resize, reposition, or remove the control.

    p For more detail on the configuration of the controls on the scene, the #[code View JSON] option in the top right of the grid section will display the relevant JSON for the scene.
    p Once you are finished building your scenes/controls, press the Save button in the top right of the grid section.

    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/grid_with_controls.png' alt='studio grid')

    h3#the-code-step Code
    p The code step is to help you complete the code portion of your project. This is usually done after you have set up the scenes and controls. This is also where you can grab the #[code Project Version ID] which is displayed in the center of the screen.

    p You will need to write your own Game Client to connect to the Interactive service. For SDK downloads, documentation, and samples, go to #[a(href='#choosing-an-sdk-environment') Choose a SDK].

    h3#publish-step Publish
    p The final step in the studio is Publish. Publish allows you to share your project with everyone on Beam.

    p To help you decide whether your Interactive project is ready for publishing, these are some questions to ask:

    ul
        li Is your project something that everyone would use?
        li Is your project ready for every Beam broadcaster to have access to?
        li Have you filled in the Info tab with #[strong detailed] installation and setup instructions?

    p If you’ve answered no to any of the questions above, you should #[strong not] publish your project yet. If you would like to have a small group of users to be able to access it, consider #[a(href='#sharing-your-project') sharing] your project instead.

    h4#publishing-flow Understand the Publishing Flow
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/PublishProcess.svg' alt='studio pubish process')
    p A Project starts off as a draft. In this state, you are free to edit, test, and share it with other users. Many projects don't leave the draft state. It's perfectly ok not to publish your project.

    p When you've decided to publish your project, go to the Publish tab in the interactive studio. It will perform some checks on the project to ensure that it meets some basic requirements before allowing you to click on the Submit button.
    p Once you've submitted your project, the Interactive review team at Beam is notified and we'll begin the review process. While a project is in review, you won't be able to edit the project. A Beam representative may also reach out to you with questions.
    p After a review is conducted, you'll be notified whether your project is accepted for publishing or not. If your project is not accepted for publishing, it goes back to the draft state with feedback from the team, detailing what needs to change so that your project can be successfully published.
    p Once your project is accepted for publishing, we can start discussing about the actual launch date; when you would like to make your project available for all Beam users in the Interactive Store.

    h3#sharing-your-project Sharing an Interactive Project
    p By default, only the owner can use the project in a broadcast. This means that when you create a project, you are only person who can broadcast the project. However, if you'd like other Beam broadcasters to stream it, you have several options.

    p To manage a project's share settings, click the Share icon on the top right of the editor, as shown in the screenshot below.
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/share/shareButton.png' alt='studio share button')
    p You'll be presented with a dialog with three options. #[strong Changing the sharing settings of a project will delete any previous share settings]

    p The first option, “Nobody can play this game until published”, is the default. Selecting this option allows only the project owner to use the project in a broadcast.

    h4#share-codes Share Codes
    p The second, “Anyone with the versionId and code can play”, option generates a share code. This code can be handed out to broadcasters who wants to use the project in their broadcasts. These broadcasters, provide it to the Game Client which can then gain access to use the project.
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/share/shareCode.png' alt='studio share code')
    h4#explicit-sharing Explicit Sharing

    p The third option, “Only allow specific users to play until published”, is explicit sharing. It lets you share the project with named Beam users. Only users in the list can use the project. To share a project with a specific user, search for their username in the search box and then click ADD.
    .figure
        img(src='/img/reference/interactive/studio/share/explicitSharing.png' alt='studio explicit sharing')

    h2#protocol-overview Protocol Overview

    p Beam's Interactive protocol is defined in a separate #[a(href='/reference/interactive/protocol/protocol.pdf' target='_blank') downloadable document] that has precise implementation details. This section provides an introduction to the protocol.

    h3#wire-format Wire Format
    p The Interactive Service communicates using a protocol similar to #[a(href='http://jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-1-2-proposal.html') JSON-RPC] except that it is bi-directional. Clients and Servers can both call and respond to methods.

    p The protocol operates over a standard WebSocket connection. Both #[a(href='#participants') Participants] and #[a(href='#the-gameclient') Game Clients] use the same protocol definition, but different subsets of methods are available to each.

    h3#packets Packets
    p The protocol contains two types of packets: #[code methods] and #[code replies].

    h4#method Method
    p A method is a request for a connected entity to perform an operation. Methods are sent by both the client and the server. When a method is received, it is processed and acknowledged by the recipient, who can then reply to the method with a result or an error.

    p A method can contain parameters which get provided to the recipient.

    p Methods contain an additional property called #[code discard], which when #[code true], indicates that the recipient can choose not to respond. Methods that can be treated as events have the #[code discard] property set to #[code true].

    h4#reply Reply
    p A reply is sent from a recipient back to the caller to informing about the result after executing the method that was sent. It can contain a #[code result] or an #[code error] which indicates what went wrong.

    p For full packet implementation details please refer to the protocol specification which you can download #[a(href='/reference/interactive/protocol/protocol.pdf' target='_blank') here].

    h3#compression Compression
    p By default, packets on the wire are transmitted as plain text, but the Game Client can opt to use #[a(href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952' target='_blank') GZIP] or #[a(href='https://lz4.github.io/lz4/' target='_blank') LZ4] compression. To do this, the Game Client must call a method providing its supported compression formats. The server will then respond with its chosen compression format.

    h3#authentication Authentication
    p A Game Client needs to authenticate as a Beam user when establishing an interactive session. There are two authentication methods available.

    h4(id='oauth-2.0') OAuth 2.0
    p Beam supports #[a(href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749' target='_blank') OAuth 2.0] flows which enable you to get a valid #[a(href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750' target='_blank') OAuth 2.0 Bearer] token. Tokens can be passed in the #[code Authorization] header when you initiate a connection to the interactive service.

    p The only required scope for an interactive connection is #[code interactive:robot:self]. For more info about Beam's OAuth, go to #[a(href='/reference/oauth/index.html' target='_blank') OAuth reference page].

    h4#xtoken XToken
    p You can provide a Xbox Live's XToken in the #[code Authorization] header when you initiate a connection to the interactive service. This authentication method is useful for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications that are Xbox Live enabled, as well as games on Xbox One.
